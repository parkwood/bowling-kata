# scoring-bowling

slim.clj has impl and tests for bowling kata. it can be trimmed down a fair bit and does some
ugly destructuring.

the core.clj version including tests took about 10 hours. i was going from bob martin's description of the 
game, which does not explain frame 10 very well. it turns out that without frame 10 it 
would be quite a simple game. also - frame 10 is not as complex as it looks. extra points
you bowl are just bonuses, not points in their own right. i didnt add behaviour to frames, or even create
a separate frame, for frame 10, until about 5 hours in. 

coding this was made much harder by the fact that protocols can only get compiled once in a repl.

looking at other peoples solutions in other languages was annoying because they seem to be missing some
requirements:
* cant get score til the end
* validate that the game ends after the 10th frame.
