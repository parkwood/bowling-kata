# scoring-bowling

the core version including tests took about 10 hours. i was going from bob martin's description of the 
game, which does not explain frame 10 very well. it turns out that without frame 10 it 
would be quite a simple game. also - frame 10 is not as complex as it looks. extra points
you bowl are just bonuses, not points in their own right.
